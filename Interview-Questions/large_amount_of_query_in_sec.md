# Large amount of query request in seconds.

- Recently, I was thinking about the black Friday or double 11 events in China. There are a lot of users rushing for the discount on the Amazon at the time of 00:00:00, which generate a lot of requests in a minute (millions of requests). How to design a system to handle this large amount of request in this short period of time, and also make sure the system to operate as usual?
