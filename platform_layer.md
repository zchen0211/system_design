# Platform Layer

- First, separating the platform and web application allow you to scale the pieces independently.
- Second, adding a platform layer can be a way to reuse your infrastructure for multiple products or interfaces (a web application, an API, an iPhone app, etc) without writing too much redundant boilerplate code for dealing with caches, databases, etc.
- Third, a sometimes underappreciated aspect of platform layers is that they make it easier to scale an organization.
